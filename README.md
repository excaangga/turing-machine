<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Turing Machine on GUI Screenshot][product-screenshot]

This project's made for a task in "Language Theory and Automata" on our college. We made a simulator of Turing Machine 
that works for basic mathematical operation and show the process as well as the result on GUI.

Here's the operations we mentioned above:
* Addition --> integer
* Substraction --> integer
* Multiplication --> integer
* Division --> integer
* Factorial --> positive integer
* Modulo --> positive integer
* Power --> positive integer
* Binary log --> both input and output must be positive integer

In this program, we made a single tape Turing Machine for the main processor. Hope this repository makes sense, happy coding!

### Built With

We built the program from these following technologies. Click the links below for installation/documentation.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To begin the program, you can follow these instructions

### Prerequisites

You can get our tech-stack by following the commands bellow (of course you don't have to if you already have it).
* python (for linux user, for windows just click the download link in "Built With")
  ```sh
  sudo apt install python3
  ```

### Install and Run

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/excaangga/turing-machine.git
   ```
2. Run the program in `gui.py`
   ```PY
   python3 gui.py
   ```
